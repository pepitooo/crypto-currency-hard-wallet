Building yourself a "hard" wallet for crypto currency

## Crypto currency is precious

As you may know it's really important to move out all your crypto currency out from exchanges website, not because they are bad, but because there is no 100% secure solutions. 

Some examples : 
- 400 000 $ lost from [jaxx](https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/users-report-losing-400000-due-to-jaxx-wallet-vulnerability/)

## Cold wallet

So the only solution is to use a cold wallet, a wallet offline, and keep it in a safe place, where no one can see it and it can't be damage by anything.

you have few solutions :
- [paper wallet](https://www.bitaddress.org)
- harware wallet like [ledger nano S](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s)
- usb stick with encrypted data in it, like the [home made tezor](https://steemit.com/trezor/@furion/build-yourself-a-trezor)
- your memory and brain

There is a big down side on this solution, what happend if your house or flat is on fire ? Are you sure all cold wallet will not melt like snow under sun ? I don't have millions in crypto currency, but I want to keep safe in anycase.

## My solution hard wallet

First for the solution I go for you need to have some tools, and motivation. I want to print a kind of paper wallet on hard and almost undestructive material.
